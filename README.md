**ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Marvin Frachet**

I'm a french software developer loving testing automation, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). I'm mostly doing product engineering but I also like to dive into deep technical concepts and learn new languages.

I'm actually building some pieces of [Gatsby Cloud](gatsbyjs.com) that aims to be the fastest platform to build Gatsby sites.
